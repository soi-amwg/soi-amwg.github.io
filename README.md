# Automated Monitoring Working Group formation

A summary of the "asynchronous discussion"

## Purpose and scope

* Build a truly global community
* Connect people, projects and expertise around automated monitoring
* Identify and develop global standards
* Share existing methods. Exchange experience
* Coordinate efforts across all automated monitoring technologies
* Support research, conservation and engagement
* Provide logistics for hardware and software development
* Synthesise the state of the art and ways forward
* First: **Decide the distinct role for this group (USP!)**

## Activites

* Symposia, webinars
* Workshops and hackathons connecting developers and users
* Round table, transcontinental discussions
* Discussions with industry
* Co-synthesise automated monitoring knowledge in a public online space (GitHub)

## Products

* A website synthesising and organising standards, methods, datasets, communities and papers
* Research articles - especially opinions/synthesis
* Expanded or global sensor networks
* Open-source database of studies with associated metrics
* A clear specification of user needs
* A modular framework for automated monitoring methods
* A golabl API to facilitate data interoperability

## Recruitment and leadership

* Suggestions for more global and early-career representation
* A cap of 15 members is difficult to work with. Perhaps we can change this?
* Tentative interest from Roel and Tom to lead/co-lead
