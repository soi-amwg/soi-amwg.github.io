# Automated Monitoring Working Group formation

A summary of the "asynchronous discussion"

## Purpose and scope

* Building a truly global community
* Connect people, projects and expertise around automated monitoring
* Identifying and developing global standards
* Sharing existing methods. Exchange experience
* Coordinating efforts across all automated monitoring technologies
* Support research, conservation and engagement
* Provide logistics for hardware and software development
* Synthesising the state of the art and ways forward
* It's crucial to decide the distinct role for this group (USP!)

## Activites

* Symposia, webinars
* Workshops and hackathons connecting developers and users
* Round table, transcontinental discussions
* Discussions with industry
* Co-synthesise automated monitoring knowledge in a public online space (GitHub)

## Products

* A website synthesising and organising methods, datasets, communities and papers
* Research articles - especially opinions/synthesis
* Expanded sensor networks
* Open-source database of studies with associated metrics
* A clear specification of user needs
* A modular framework for automated monitoring methods

## Recruitment and leadership

* Suggestions for more global and early-career representation
* A cap of 15 members is difficult to work with. Perhaps we can change this?
* Tentative interest from Roel and Tom to lead/co-lead
